# PONG!

This is a [simplegui implementation](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_ceAPsRyNBj_1.py) of the classic game pong.

It was built on [codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org) as part of a course assignment on coursera.

### SimpleGUI

SimpleGUI was developed using JavaScript for the online python interpreter CodeSkulptor, both developed by proffesor [Scott Rixner](https://github.com/rixner).

Shoutout to [David Holm](https://github.com/dholm) for bringing it as a [python library](https://github.com/dholm/simpleguitk).
